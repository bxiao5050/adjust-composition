# Adjust composition for sputtering experiment
## Overview
Since the film characteristics are determined by stoichiometric conformity; the evaluation of the resulting element ratio in the film is decisive. This tool is designed to calculat relationship between cathode power and the element content in order to minimize the number of experiments for desired composition.
